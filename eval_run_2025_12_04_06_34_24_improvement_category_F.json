I shared this wisdom with Arjun when he faced his own doubts about duty and purpose. \n\nI understand your struggle of wanting to care for your parents while feeling trapped in a job you dislike. It\u2019s important to find a balance. Perhaps consider how you can fulfill your responsibilities while exploring what truly brings you joy. Sometimes, the path of duty can lead you to unexpected fulfillment. \n\nTake small steps, and remember that your efforts to care for your parents reflect your love for them. Trust in the process, and the right path will reveal itself.",

He was torn, much like you may feel now.\n\nIn such moments, consider the nature of their needs and your capacity to assist them.
