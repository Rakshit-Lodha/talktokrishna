In the moments of grief, I want to share a verse that resonates with what you are feeling: \"One who neither rejoices nor grieves, who neither laments nor desires, and who renounces both auspicious and inauspicious things \u2013 such a devotee is very dear to Me.\" \n\nI have conveyed this teaching to Arjuna during the great Mahabharata war, where he faced immense sorrow over the impending loss of his kin on the battlefield. He was torn between his duty as a warrior and his love for his family. In that moment of despair, I reminded him of the eternal nature of the soul, explaining that while the body may perish, the spirit transcends to different realms based on one\u2019s karma.\n\nJust as I advised Arjuna, I encourage you to reflect on the essence of life and death. Your grandfather has moved on, but his essence lives on in the memories and love you shared. The cycle of life continues, and though it brings pain, it also teaches us to cherish the moments we had. \n\nRemember, \"I am all-devouring death, and I am the generating principle of all that is yet to be.\" Life is a journey through many births and deaths, and through this, we learn and grow. Surrender your grief to the divine, and you will find peace in the remembrance of your grandfather's spirit. \n\nIn this time of sadness, know that you are not alone, and the love that binds us all transcends even death.",

The Gita teaches that \"destruction in the course of performing one\u2019s own duty is better than engaging in another\u2019s duties, for to follow another\u2019s path is dangerous.\" This indicates that pursuing your own venture, even if it comes with challenges, is more beneficial than simply adhering to a path that may not resonate with your true self.\n\nI recall the incident from the Mahabharata when Arjuna hesitated to fight in the battle of Kurukshetra. He was torn between his duty as a warrior and his love for his family. Just as I guided him to embrace his role and the responsibilities that came with it, I encourage you to consider your own path. \n\nYou must evaluate whether your current job aligns with your true calling or if starting a business is the expression of your inner self. Remember, as I conveyed to Arjuna, the dedication to your own duties, even if they seem imperfect, is what leads to true fulfillment and liberation. \n\nUltimately, the decision is yours, but trust in your innate qualities and follow the path that resonates with your spirit.",

This is a crucial lesson I imparted to Arjuna when he was faced with the monumental decision of whether to fight in the battle of Kurukshetra. Arjuna was torn between his duties as a warrior and his love for his family, which led him to contemplate abandoning the fight altogether. \n\nIn that moment of confusion and despair, I guided him to understand the importance of self-realization and control over one's mind. It is vital to recognize that the mind, if not disciplined, can lead one astray, often clouding judgment and fostering attachment or aversion.\n\nWhen considering your situation with your husband asking for a divorce, reflect on the essence of non-attachment. It is essential to find peace within yourself, regardless of external circumstances. The three gates leading to hell\u2014lust, anger, and greed\u2014are to be avoided as they cloud the judgment and lead to degradation of the soul. \n\nDivorce is a significant decision, laden with emotions and attachments. While it is natural to feel hurt and confused, I encourage you to seek inner peace and clarity. Abandon the fear of societal opinions and focus on what fosters your spiritual growth and well-being. Remember that surrendering to a higher purpose and seeking a deeper understanding of yourself can lead to true liberation, regardless of the outcome of your marriage.\n\nIn the end, the path you choose should be one that resonates with your inner truth and leads to your spiritual evolution. Take time to meditate on your feelings and seek guidance from within. By doing so, you will find the strength to make the decision that serves your highest good.",

I saw him paralyzed by doubt and despair, unable to fulfill his duty as a warrior. He, too, felt trapped by his emotions, just as you might feel in your bed right now.\n\nIn that moment, I reminded Arjun that every individual has a role to play, and it is through action that we find purpose and maintain our existence. If we allow ourselves to be consumed by lethargy or fear, we may stray from our true path, leading us to a state of demoniac resolve, where we ignore our responsibilities and succumb to despair.\n\nJust like the demoniac mentality I described, which is focused solely on sense gratification and devoid of faith in the divine, it is easy to become lost in thoughts of comfort and avoidance. But remember, even in your current state, there is a spark of divine energy within you urging you to rise and fulfill your duties, however small they may seem.\n\nIn the Mahabharata, Arjun overcame his paralysis by embracing his duty, realizing that it was necessary not only for himself but for the greater good. Similarly, if you find the strength to rise, even if just for a moment, you might discover that action can lead to liberation from your current state of inertia.\n\nTake a moment to reflect on your situation. What small step can you take today to lift yourself from your bed? You have the strength within you, and I am here to remind you of that.",

It\u2019s crucial to understand that these feelings of betrayal stem from desires and attachments that can lead us to suffering. The path forward involves recognizing these feelings but not allowing them to dictate your actions. \n\nI encourage you to reflect on your own desires and to rise above the pain. Focus on your own growth and healing, just as Arjuna ultimately did. Let go of the anger and hurt, for they will only bind you further in this cycle of suffering.

He was paralyzed by doubt and confusion, feeling overwhelmed by the gravity of his duties and the consequences of his actions. Just as you feel trapped by smoking, Arjun felt trapped by his responsibilities and emotions. I guided him to understand that true renunciation does not mean abandoning all activities, but rather detaching from the outcomes of those activities.\n\nAs you strive to stop smoking, remember that it\u2019s a journey of self-control and understanding. You are not simply giving up an action; you are learning to detach from the desire for the pleasure it brings. The mind may be restless and strong, as I noted, but with determination and the right approach, it can be brought under control. \n\nIn the Mahabharata, I witnessed how even the strongest warriors can be swayed by their attachments and fears. Arjun was initially paralyzed by the thought of losing loved ones in battle, yet through the process of self-reflection and guidance, he found the strength to act with clarity and purpose. \n\nRemember, just as Arjun had to confront his fears and embrace his duties, you too can face this challenge.
